Thank you for providing those details. Let's analyze this situation to determine if you can upload your directory to the vector store without significant issues.



Given your specifications:
- Directory size: 2.2GB
- Number of files: ~11,000
- System specs: 32GB RAM, GTX 1080, i7-8700 3.2GHz

Analysis:

1. File Size:
   - Average file size: 2.2GB / 11,000 â‰ˆ 200KB per file
   - This is a reasonable size for text documents.

2. RAM:
   - 32GB is sufficient for handling this process.
   - It provides ample space for PostgreSQL operations and embedding generation.

3. CPU:
   - i7-8700 is a capable processor that should handle the workload well.

4. GPU:
   - GTX 1080 isn't directly used by PostgreSQL or pgvector, but it could be utilized for embedding generation if you switch to a GPU-enabled embedding model.

5. Storage:
   - Ensure you have enough free space on your drive for the database. You'll need the original 2.2GB plus additional space for embeddings and indexes.

6. Embedding Process:
   - The nomic-embed-text model you're using is CPU-based, so the embedding generation might be the most time-consuming part.

Conclusion:
Yes, you should be able to upload your directory to the vector store without much headache, but it will take some time.

Recommendations for a smooth process:

1. Batch Processing:
   Instead of trying to upload all 11,000 files at once, process them in smaller batches (e.g., 100 or 500 files at a time). This will help manage memory usage and allow you to track progress more easily.

2. Error Handling:
   Implement robust error handling to catch and log any issues with individual files without stopping the entire process.

3. Progress Tracking:
   Add a progress bar or logging to keep track of how many files have been processed.

4. Optimize for Speed:
   Consider using multiprocessing to parallelize the embedding generation, as this is likely to be the bottleneck.

5. Database Indexing:
   Create appropriate indexes in your PostgreSQL database to ensure efficient querying later.

6. Regular Commits:
   Commit your database transactions regularly to avoid holding large transactions in memory.

Here's a Python script outline to help you implement these recommendations:

```python
import os
from tqdm import tqdm
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed
from typing import List, Tuple

def process_file(file_path: str) -> Tuple[str, List[float], dict]:
    # Read file content
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()
    
    # Generate embedding
    embedding = get_embedding(content)
    
    # Create metadata
    metadata = {
        "source": file_path,
        "size": os.path.getsize(file_path),
        "last_modified": os.path.getmtime(file_path)
    }
    
    return content, embedding, metadata

def batch_process_directory(directory: str, batch_size: int = 100):
    file_paths = [os.path.join(root, file) 
                  for root, _, files in os.walk(directory) 
                  for file in files]
    
    total_files = len(file_paths)
    print(f"Found {total_files} files to process.")
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        for i in range(0, total_files, batch_size):
            batch = file_paths[i:i+batch_size]
            futures = [executor.submit(process_file, file_path) for file_path in batch]
            
            for future in tqdm(as_completed(futures), total=len(batch), desc=f"Processing batch {i//batch_size + 1}"):
                content, embedding, metadata = future.result()
                try:
                    store_document(content, metadata, embedding)
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error storing document: {e}")
            
            print(f"Completed batch {i//batch_size + 1} of {(total_files + batch_size - 1) // batch_size}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory_to_process = "/path/to/your/directory"
    batch_process_directory(directory_to_process)

```

To use this script:

1. Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path to your 2.2GB directory.
2. Ensure your `get_embedding` and `store_document` functions are properly defined and optimized.
3. Adjust the `batch_size` if needed.

This script will process your files in batches, use multiprocessing to speed up embedding generation, and provide progress updates. It should allow you to upload your entire directory to the vector store without overwhelming your system.

Keep in mind that the entire process may still take several hours, depending on the complexity of your documents and the speed of embedding generation. However, with this approach, you should be able to process all 11,000 files without running into memory issues or system instability.
